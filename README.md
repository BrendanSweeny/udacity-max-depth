=================

My answer to Udacity's CS101 course problem set 3-7.

I found it incredibly hard at first, but slowly figured it out on my own and ended up feeling incredibly accomplished.

Hence, I thought it would a good inaugural repository to introduce myself to GitHub.

So if for some reason you are reading this, first: you must be lost, second: welcome! Share in my feeling of accomplishment.

Instructions from Udacity:

Modify the crawl_web procedure to take a second parameter,
# max_depth, that limits the depth of the search.  We can 
# define the depth of a page as the number of links that must
# be followed to reach that page starting from the seed page,
# that is, the length of the shortest path from the seed to
# the page.  No pages whose depth exceeds max_depth should be
# included in the crawl
